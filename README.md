# Attendance-Manager
This app solves the attendance management problems faced by college or university students who need to compulsorily attend a minimum percentage of classes each semester or session.
Attendance of each subject is displayed along with the percentage and status which notify how many classes you need to attend to fulfill the percentage criteria as a student.
If the need arises, you can edit the attendance criteria that you need to fulfill as a student.

There are several potential benefits to using an attendance manager:

1. An attendance manager can help students stay organized and on track
with their class schedules, and can provide an easy way for students to
view and track their own attendance records.

2. An attendance manager can help ensure that students are meeting their
attendance requirements, and can provide an easy way for students to
track their own attendance records.

3. By providing an easy and convenient way for students to mark their
attendance, an attendance manager can help increase student engagement
and accountability in the classroom.
